        <p>My favourite animal is a dog!</p>
        <p>Let us learn about my dog</p>
        <p>My dog is called Gerald it is a brown fluffy husky and I love it very much.Gerald mostly loves eating meat and dog food, I tried giving it cake one day though.</p>
        <p>Gerald enjoys playing catch out in the sun, going for a walk and sometimes swimming.He does this almost everyday but daily walks are necessary and healthy to the dog.,fortunately,they enjoy it.</p>
